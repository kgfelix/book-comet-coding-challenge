# Book Comet: Front-End Coding Challenge

You are hired as a front-end developer to work on a new project: e-commerce called "bookcomet.com", for a book publisher.

You were designated to create a new front-end project for the new API:

https://publishing-house-service.herokuapp.com/docs

## Instructions:
* Interpret the above documentation and create a "CRUD" GUI for all operations described in the documentation above (with the exception of the health check);
* Note that in the API there are three search options: all books, by id and a query parameter where you can search all books by author's name (or part of the name);
* You must deliver your project in a public GitHub repository (no deployment is required);
* You must use Angular/Typescript;
* Don't forget to put comments in your code and use a well-defined directory structure;
* Provide good error handling;
* Unit tests are welcome;
